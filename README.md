## About The Project

This project is for a university course, alongside this what motivated us to put effort in it is that it enhanced our skills and made us more aware of github and MERN STACK.

### Course :
Advanced Computer Lab (CSEN 704/ DMET706) , Winter 2021. 

### Theme :
The project is all about an online airline reservation system, through our website a guest could search for flights, get informed about the prices and available seats, however a user can reserve, edit his reservation, pay in addition to everything a guest can do.

### Overview :
We implement this project following the Agile methodology, as the project is divided into 3 sprints. Each sprint has a specific deadline and a specific amount of time. Through this period , we should deliver fully functioning code with specific System requirements which were function and non-functional.

### Objectives :
- Learn how to work and collaborate within a team on GitHub. 
- Learn how to use the MERN Stack and do a lot of research to master its concepts.
- Learn how to develop software by following a specified set of System Requirements.
- Learn how to correctly do a project and develop software using the Agile Methodology.

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework for front-end web development that is responsive and mobile-first. It includes design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface elements that are based on CSS and JavaScript.<br />
####[MUI](https://mui.com/) :
MUI is a React User Interface Library. MUI is a comprehensive, flexible, and easily available library of foundational and advanced components that allows you to create your own design system and construct React apps more quickly.<br />
####[Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) :
An enterprise-class UI design language and React UI library with a set of high-quality React components, one of best React UI library for enterprises.<br />

#### Backend and Database:
####[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) : 
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.<br />
####[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/):
Express.js or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.<br />
####[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_emea_egypt_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624392&adgroup=115749716783):

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
on the beginning of every sprint we met, divided the work and divided ourselves 2 groups, group of 3 and group of 2 and each member of the group worked in parallel with the other member.
we used to join a zoom meeting everyday night for an hour or two to follow up with our work and discuss problems and try solve them.
By the end of each sprint we always join everything together make some last changes and submit.
